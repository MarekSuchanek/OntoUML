**Characterization** is a relation between a *bearer type* and its
*feature.* Feature is intrinsic (inherent) moment of its bearer type,
and thus *existentially dependent* on the bearer. Feature may be
stereotyped as \ *«Quality»* or *«Mode».* Feature *characterizes* a
bearer type iff every instance of bearer exemplifies the feature.
