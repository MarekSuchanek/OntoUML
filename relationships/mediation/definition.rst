We define a relation of **mediation** between a *relator* and the
entities it connects. Mediation is a type of *existential dependence*
relation (a form of nonfunctional inherence). It can be derived from the
relation between the relata and the *qua individiuals* that compose the
relator and that inhere in the relata. A relator must mediate at least
two distinct individuals.
