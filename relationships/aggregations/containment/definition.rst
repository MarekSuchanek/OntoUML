Containment is a relation between a container and its contents -- a
`Quantity </ufo/wiki/quantity/>`__\ *,* e.g. a barrel contains beer.
Multiplicities of the containment relation must be exactly one for the
same reason as those of the
`SubquantityOf </ufo/wiki/part-whole-relation/subquantityof/>`__
relation.
