Constraints
-----------

**R1:** This relation can only represent **essential** parthood if the
object representing the whole is **extensional** (i.e. provided that
adding or removing of any member changes the identity of the
collective). In this case, all parthood relations in which the whole is
extensioanl are constrained as **{essential}** parthood relations.
**R2:** The classifier connected to the whole end must be a
`Collective </ufo/wiki/collective>`__. The classifier connected to the
part end can be either a `Collective </ufo/wiki/collective>`__, or
`functional complex </ufo/wiki/part-whole-relation/componentof/>`__.
