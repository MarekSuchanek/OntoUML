MemberOf is a parthood relation between a `functional
complex </ufo/wiki/part-whole-relation/componentof/>`__ or a
`Collective </ufo/wiki/collective>`__ (as a part) and a
`Collective </ufo/wiki/collective>`__ (as a whole). Examples include:
(a) a tree is part of forest; (b) a card is part of a deck of cards; (c)
a fork is part of cutlery set; (d) a club member is part of a club.
MemberOf relation obeys *weak supplementation principle* (at least 2
parts are required, may be of different types). The memberOf relation is
**intransitive.** For example, Kazi, Bobek, Nemo and others are members
of the *TJ Sokol Zizkov* Youth Tourist Club. The TJ Sokol Zizkov Youth
Tourist Club is the member of the Association of the Youth Tourist
Clubs. But Kazi, Bobek, Nemo and others are not members of
theÂ \ Association of the Youth Tourist Clubs, since not persons but only
clubs may be members of the association. Although transitivity does not
hold across two memberOf relations, a memberOf relation followed
by\ \ `subCollectionOf </ufo/wiki/part-whole-relation/subcollectionof/>`__\ \ is
transitive.
