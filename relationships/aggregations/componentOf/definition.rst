ComponentOf is a parthood relation between two complexes. Examples
include: (a) my hand is part of my arm; (b) a car engine is part of a
car; (c) an Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) is part of a Central Process
Unit (CPU); (d) a heart is part of a circulatory system.
**Transitivity** holds for certain cases but not for others, it depends
on context. ComponentOf relation obeys *weak supplementation principle*
(at least 2 parts are required, may be of different types).
