The **«Phase»** stereotype is used to represent **anti-rigid** subtypes
of identity providers («Kind», «Collective», «Quantity», «Relator»,
«Mode» and «Quantity») that are instantiated by changes in intrinsic
properties (e.g. the age of a person, the color of an object, the
condition of a car). All instances of a particular «Phase» must follow
the same identity principle. Phases always come in partitions. *Tip:
When defining a phase partition, think about which property (or
properties) variation is causing the instantiation of the phases and
include it in your model. For instance, when defining the phases Child,
Adult and Elder for Person, you should include an age property for the
type Person.* Here are some examples of phases:
