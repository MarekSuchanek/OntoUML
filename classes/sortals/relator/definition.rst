The **«Relator»** construct is used to represent truth-makers of
material relations, i.e., the "things" that must exist in order for two
or more individuals to be connected by material relations. Because of
this nature, relators are always dependent on other individuals to
exist. Here are some examples of concepts classified as relators:

Note that the Relator meta-class is analogous to the Kind, Collective
and Quantity meta-classes, in the sense that it is rigid and provide an
identity principle for its instances. The difference is that, instead of
representing functional complexes, quantities or collections, a
«Relator» represents the objectification of relational properties. The
direct consequence is that relators can also be specialised by subkinds,
phases and roles, and generalised by categories and mixins.
